    <div class="upper"><pre> As an up and coming Uni Student, my indecision to 
    find an Ideal job to suit my needs has led me to pick not one, 
    but 3 jobs for the task at hand. They will be listed below.</pre></div>
    </br>
<section><h2 class="leader"> Communication Electronic Technician</h2>
<div class="gallery">
<a target="blank" href="https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/air-force/communication-electronic-technician">

</br>
<div class="first"><p>This is a tech role in the Australian Airforce, that is to assist the airforce in maintaining many/most/all electronic systems required in the day-to-day operations of the Airforce. This includes but not limited to Satellite systems, RADAR, radio, Onboard equipment, etc. In an operational sense, the Electronic Technician is required/expected to be able to operate communications equipment, as well as maintain it during active combat. Obviously the technician isn’t to be on any front line, but to be stationed either state-side or in the theatre of battle. Looking to join a role such as this, is of particular interest to me as I’ve wanted to join the army since I was a kid. As I grew up, my reality changed and my dreams changed, and I shifted my focus less from joining the Army as an Enlisted and more into Armoured Corps - Tanks/Armoured Vehicles I find fascinating - but now heading into an IT Degree, shifting my attention towards the electronic/networking/IT specialists/technications is not only a focal point for what I aspire to be, but also something manageable for what I am heading towards.</p>
<p>Much like all roles/jobs in the Australian Military, the Electronic Technician only requires a pass in Year 10 education as well as passes in English and Mathematics. This one however also requires a pass in Science, most notably a Physics component. To become qualified, one must hold at least a Certification III in Electronic Communications. Once recruited into these roles, one undergoes extensive training/education to prepare them for the role. As it stands currently, with an exception for the Cert III, I currently possess all requirements to enroll for this Job.</p>
<p>Once completing further education in the form of a degree of Information and Technology, I would feel prepared enough to undertake applying to be recruited into a service role such as this. All the skills required wouldn’t be fulfilled through doing a Bachelor’s Degree, but it’d prepare one enough for them to be confident in the field, so that any extended training for the role would come to them naturally. As such, if I were to begin preparing myself for the role, I wouldn’t be ready to fill out for a period of time as little as half a decade, and as long as a decade.

<section><h2 class="leader">CIS - Communication Information and Systems Operator</h2>
<div class="gallery">
<a target="blank" href="https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/navy/communication-and-information-systems-operator">
<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/e7ff3ecbfdf989fd23f7d545a275cb18.jpg" alt="landscape" width="800" height="325">
</a>
</br>
<div class="first"><p>Much like the Communications Electronic Technician, the CIS would be responsible for Communication and electronic systems, but while in service to the Royal Australian Navy. There would be a couple different postings for a role such as this, including being stationed on a surface warship, or being stationed aboard a submarine vessel. Both roles would be similar to each other, and quite similar to the Air Force Electronic Technician, except for they’d be serving in the Navy. After approximately 1 year of service as a CIS, you’d be on track to learning to become a CIS-S or Communications and Informations Systems Officer Specialist, which, as the name suggests, is a more specialised CIS officer to fulfill a more specific role.</p>
<p>
Significant more training is required to become a CIS as they are required to learn all Navy Protocols and Communication Protocols including (but not limited to) Morse Code, Signal Flags and encoding/decoding transmissions between vessels. Although the above two roles have IT elements in them, they are more hands-on roles in the Australian Military. They require significant skills outside standard IT capabilities, but they are not the only roles that I am interested in.

<section><h2 class="leader"> CWA - Cyberspace Warfare Analyst</h2>
<div class="gallery">
<a target="blank" href="https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/air-force/cyberspace-warfare-analyst">
<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/141f605480944cce412333a4cd226ae8.jpg" alt="landscape" width="800" height="325">
</a>
<div class="first"><p>The Cyberspace Warfare Analyst is a role that spans all 3 branches, but with slightly different names and roles. The Analyst is an Air Force-primary role which focuses on Cyber Warfare defensive duties. Although not required, to be fundamentally prepared for the role, I would be confident in doing a Civilian Cyber Security subject. Like most other Military roles, The Air Force pays you to enroll in a specific degree to fulfill the requirements for the role. Upon being recruited for the role, one goes through basic military training, before conducting a 40-week technical Initial Employment Training to cover all required topics for the role.
